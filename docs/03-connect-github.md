# 3 — Connect GitHub to AWS

After this, saving a change to GitHub publishes the website. That is the whole
workflow from then on.

About 15 minutes.

---

## 3.1 Get the code onto your computer

Install **Git for Windows** (<https://git-scm.com/download/win>) — the default
options are fine. Or **GitHub Desktop** (<https://desktop.github.com/>) if you
would rather not use a terminal.

Then, in Command Prompt, in a folder where you keep projects:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO.git
```

If the repository is empty, copy the site files in now — the `src/` folder,
`.github/`, `docs/`, `infra/`, `README.md` and `.gitignore`.

> **Copy the files, not a whole other folder from another machine.** A copied
> folder that still points at someone else's repository will look like it is
> working and silently push to the wrong place.

## 3.2 Fill in the workflow file

Open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Near the top:

```yaml
env:
  AWS_REGION: us-east-2
  AMPLIFY_APP_ID: xxxxxxxxxxxx
  AMPLIFY_BRANCH: main
```

and further down:

```yaml
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/xxxxx-github-deploy
```

Replace all four with the values from your stack's **Outputs** tab — the
`WorkflowEnvBlock` output lists exactly these four, in this order, so you can
copy them across one at a time.

Nothing else in the file needs changing.

> **No password or key goes in this file, and none should.** The role ARN is
> not a secret — it is the *name* of a permission, and it only works for a
> workflow running in your repository, on your branch. Anyone else who quotes
> it gets refused.

## 3.3 Publish

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial site"
git push
```

If Git asks you to sign in, a browser window opens — approve it there. That
happens once.

## 3.4 Watch the first deploy

Go to your repository on GitHub → **Actions** tab. A run named **Deploy to
Amplify** starts within a few seconds.

- **Green tick** → open the `TemporaryUrl` from your stack outputs. The site is
  live. If you attached a domain, try that too — if it does not resolve yet,
  DNS is still propagating, which can take up to an hour.
- **Red X** → click into the run, expand the failed step, read on.

---

## 3.5 When the first deploy fails

Almost always one of two things, and the first is the one people lose hours to.

### "Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"

AWS declined to hand credentials to the workflow. The error deliberately does
not say why, so you have to look at what was actually presented.

**First, check the obvious:** the owner and repository names in the stack
parameters must exactly match GitHub, and you must be pushing to the branch
named in `AMPLIFY_BRANCH`. A typo in either produces exactly this error.

**If those are right,** find the real subject claim in CloudTrail. AWS records
every rejected attempt:

```bash
aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity --max-results 5 --query "Events[].CloudTrailEvent" --output text
```

In that output, find `"userName"`. It looks like one of these:

```
repo:my-org/my-site:ref:refs/heads/main
repo:my-org@9330587/my-site@1366852467:ref:refs/heads/main
```

The template trusts **both** forms, so if what you see matches neither, the
owner or repository name is wrong — compare it character by character against
the address bar on GitHub.

> This is worth knowing about generally: which of those two forms GitHub sends
> is not something you can determine in advance, and guides that only handle
> the first form fail here with no explanation. If you are adapting these
> instructions for another project, carry both patterns across.

**Also possible:** the workflow is missing its permission to request a token.
The file must contain:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
```

### "AccessDeniedException" on an Amplify call

The app ID in the workflow does not match the app the role is allowed to touch
— usually a copy-paste that picked up a stray character, or a second stack
created and the wrong output copied. Compare `AMPLIFY_APP_ID` against the
stack's `AmplifyAppId` output.

### The run does not start at all

The workflow only triggers on changes under `src/`. To publish without a
content change, go to **Actions** → **Deploy to Amplify** → **Run workflow**.

---

## 3.6 Decide who can publish

Right now, anyone who can push to `main` changes the live site within a minute,
with no review.

For one or two careful people that is fine, and it keeps things simple. If more
people will have access, or if the site carries information people rely on,
require review:

Repository **Settings** → **Branches** → **Add branch ruleset** → target
`main` → enable **Require a pull request before merging**.

Changes then arrive as pull requests that someone approves, and merging
publishes. Slower by a few minutes, and it means no single mistake goes live
unseen.

## Check it worked

- [ ] Actions run finished green
- [ ] `TemporaryUrl` shows the site
- [ ] Custom domain shows the site, and `http://` and the bare domain both end
      up at `https://www.`
- [ ] A small edit to a file in `src/`, pushed, appears live within two minutes
