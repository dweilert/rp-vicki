# Deploying a static site: GitHub to AWS

A complete, repeatable setup for hosting a static website on AWS, published
from GitHub, with **no passwords or access keys stored anywhere**.

Written to be followed by someone who is comfortable with a computer but is not
a developer, and to be reusable for other sites and other organizations.

## What you end up with

- A website on AWS Amplify Hosting, on your own domain, with HTTPS
- Editing by saving a file to GitHub — live in about a minute
- No AWS keys in GitHub. The connection is short-lived tokens that expire in
  minutes and only work from your repository, on your branch
- A permission scoped so tightly that the worst a compromised workflow can do
  is publish a bad version of this one site
- Every change recorded, and any change reversible
- A cost alert, because a volunteer organization should hear about a surprise
  bill from an email rather than a card statement

Under **$25 a year**, nearly all of it the domain name.

## The steps

| | | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [01-prerequisites.md](01-prerequisites.md) | AWS account, securing it, domain, GitHub account | ~90 min |
| [02-deploy-stack.md](02-deploy-stack.md) | Upload one template; it builds the infrastructure | ~10 min |
| [03-connect-github.md](03-connect-github.md) | Wire the repository to AWS, first publish | ~15 min |
| [05-runbook.md](05-runbook.md) | Everything afterwards — editing, rollback, removing people, costs | reference |

Do them in order. Step 2 fails in confusing ways if step 1 was not finished.

[`infra/site-stack.yaml`](../infra/site-stack.yaml) is the template. It is
commented throughout, and the comments explain *why*, not just what — it is
meant to be read by whoever inherits this.

## How it fits together

```
  You edit a file  ──push──▶  GitHub  ──▶  GitHub Actions
                                                │
                                   asks GitHub for a short-lived token,
                                   AWS checks it came from your repo
                                                │
                                                ▼
                                        AWS Amplify Hosting
                                                │
                                                ▼
                                        visitors see the site
```

Permission flows one way. GitHub can publish to AWS; AWS has no access to
GitHub. Nothing long-lived is stored at either end.

## Two things worth deciding early

**Who owns the accounts.** Register the AWS account and the GitHub account to
the *organization* rather than to a person, if you can. If that is not possible
yet, personal works to start — an AWS root email can be changed later, and
GitHub converts a personal account into an organization without losing
anything — but write it down as a task rather than discovering it when someone
becomes unreachable.

Note that a **GitHub Organization is free**: the Free plan covers unlimited
public and private repositories with unlimited collaborators. Cost is not a
reason to stay on a personal account. The reason to care is that a personal
account has exactly one owner and no way to add a second.

**Who can publish.** By default, a push to `main` goes live immediately with no
review. That is fine for one or two careful people. For a larger group, or for
a site carrying information people rely on, turn on required pull requests —
[03-connect-github.md](03-connect-github.md) §3.6.

## If you get stuck

Each step ends with a checklist and a table of common failures with their
fixes. The two that account for most lost time:

- **Resources seem to have disappeared** — check the region selector, top
  right of the console
- **First deploy refused with an authorization error** —
  [03-connect-github.md](03-connect-github.md) §3.5, which includes how to read
  what AWS actually saw

## Scope

This covers hosting a static site: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images. No server, no
database, no build step.

A separate document will cover the optional admin area — letting non-technical
people edit part of the site from a browser without touching GitHub — once that
is built.
